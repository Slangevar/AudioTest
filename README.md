# AudioTest

A self-entertaining project to record audio and translate it into words with the help of Xunfei API. Because Xunfei API works nice with the format `pcm`, I use `ffmpeg` here. Therefore, users of this project need to install ffmpeg and add it to the `PATH`.

When using it, simply put the three files into the same directory and then open `cmd`. Enter `python main.py` and you will see how it works.

I largely adopt the code of XunFei Demo and another author's audio recording file (Sorry I forget the author's name). I did not do much.
